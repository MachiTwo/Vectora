Vectora's backend infrastructure is designed to solve the biggest bottleneck for modern AI agents: **state management at scale**. While the Vectora runtime processes intelligence, the backend ensures that this intelligence is grounded in persistent, secure, and searchable data.

Vectora uses a unified architecture based on **MongoDB Atlas**, allowing vectors, metadata, and operational memory to coexist within the same ecosystem.

## The Engine Behind Context

## Architecture Overview

Vectora's backend is not just a storage location; it is an extension of the **Agentic Framework**.

```

## Backend Principles

1. **Namespace Isolation (RBAC)**: The backend enforces strict boundaries. Data from one project never mixes with others, ensuring multi-tenant privacy.
2. **Atomicity**: Code vectors and metadata are stored together. If a file is updated, the vector index and the document are updated simultaneously.
3. **Transparent Scalability**: Using MongoDB Atlas, Vectora scales from small individual projects to enterprise codebases with millions of lines of code without performance loss.
4. **Active Governance**: Every interaction is persisted and auditable, allowing full transparency over AI actions.

## Backend Modes

| Mode                    | Description                                                                           | Ideal Use                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Managed (SaaS)**      | MongoDB Atlas backend provisioned by Kaffyn. Zero configuration.                      | Free, Pro, and Team plans.                 |
| **Hybrid (BYOK)**       | You provide [Voyage](/concepts/embeddings/) API keys, but Atlas is managed by Kaffyn. | API cost control with easy infrastructure. |
| **Enterprise / Custom** | Connection to your own MongoDB Atlas cluster or on-premise infrastructure.            | Strict data sovereignty requirements.      |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Where are my vectors physically stored?**
R: In MongoDB Atlas clusters managed by Kaffyn, typically located in low-latency AWS or Google Cloud regions.

**Q: Is my backend data used to train Kaffyn's models?**
R: **No.** We follow a strict privacy policy. Your vectors and metadata are your exclusive property and used only to provide context to your agent.

**Q: Is the backend required for offline mode?**
R: Vectora allows local caching of some metadata, but full semantic vector search and long-term persistent memory depend on backend connectivity.
